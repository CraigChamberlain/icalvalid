<title>iCalendar Validator: Unparseable Input</title>

<p>
The validator couldn't parse your input. Things to check:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Was the URL correct?
</li>
<li>
Was it really in iCalendar format? Sometimes, for example, an URL that you think points to an iCalendar feed really points to a web page that in turn points to the feed.
</li>
<li>
Does it load into another calendar program, such as Google Calendar, Hotmail Calendar, Outlook, etc? If not then there's almost certainly something badly wrong.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If your feed fails in other calendar programs too, here's how to narrow down the problem:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Capture a copy of the feed in a file.
</li>
<li>
Try removing things and validating each reduced version as a snippet. Eventually you'll get to a minimal version that works. Then try adding things back to see what breaks. 
</li>
</ul>
