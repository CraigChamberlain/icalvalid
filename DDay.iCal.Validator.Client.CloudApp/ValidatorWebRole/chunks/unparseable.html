<p>
The validator couldn't parse your input. Things to check:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Look below for an error message from the parser.
</li>
<li>
Was the URL correct?
</li>
<li>
Was it really in iCalendar format? Sometimes, for example, an URL that you think points to an iCalendar feed really points to a web page that in turn points to the feed.
</li>
<li>
Does it load into another calendar program, such as Google Calendar, Hotmail Calendar, Outlook, etc? If not then there's almost certainly something badly wrong.
</li>
</ul>
