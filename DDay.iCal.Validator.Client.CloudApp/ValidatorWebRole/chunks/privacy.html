<h1>What the Validator saves</h1>
<p>
When you use the URL method of validation, the Validator assigns an ID to each 
    calendar you validate, it saves the calendar along with the validation results, 
    and it displays a permalink to the saved calendar and results. </p>
<p>
Note that the permalink that represents the results of an URL-based validation is semi-private. You can can use 
the permalink, or share it, but it's unprotected and could be discovered by someone else.
</p>
<h1>What the Validator does not save</h1>
<ol>
<li>
Calendars submitted using File Upload or Snippet.
</li>
<li>
The IP addresses or user-agent strings associated with users of URL-based validation.
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Rationale for saving calendars and results</h1>
<p>
If you use URL-based validation, the data you are sending to the validator is already public at the URL you specify. 
Results are saved in this case in order to help improve the iCalendar ecosystem. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A public namespace of correct and incorrect iCalendar examples will facilitate discourse about the examples.
</li>
<li>
Analysis of iCalendar examples created by a broad range of iCalendar-producing components will be helpful 
to the authors of those components.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to opt out</h1>
<p>
If you want to validate without permitting data collection, use one of the transient methods: File Upload or Snippet.</p>
